## 大局
He lost sight of the bigger picture.

## love
when I told you that I missed you, I didn't mean to make you feel pressured.

Maybe we were meant to be together.

I'm not complete without you.

I'm better off because I had you in my life.

A home is more than bricks and mortar, it's a feeling of belonging, love, hope for the future.

Whoever breaks her's in for a wide ride.

Maybe this thing between us is clouding my judgment.

### seperate
What if I can't be the person that you need?

It okay to miss someone we've lost.

Although I take joy in thee, I take no joy of this contract tonight. It's too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
It can be hard to face that my time with someone is coming to an end. Some times it's easier to just send them away before it hits you, like Juliet's doing.

I'm unsure what happens next. But endings are necessary for growth. No matter how painful they may be.

### death
I felt the weight of her death.

I think I just know how to deal with separate now, so it doesn't affect me as mush as it once did.

Those days are past us now.

### animal / control
Don't deny the animal, but don't let it control you either.

Don't go wasting that trying to keep everything under your control.

## hard
I've tried harder at this than I ever have at anything.

## hope
The future isn't set. There is still hope.

## possibility
Sometimes, great possiblities are right in front of us, and we don't see them, because we choose not to.
He took a leap, and it changed his life for the better.

## 随缘
Allowing events to unfold naturally turned out in our favor.

## 面对
We have to live with the choices we make.

You're just postponing the inevitable. 推迟了不可避免的事

It's time to grow up and face the music(现实)

Life is beautiful and terrible, all at the same time. But if we're only living part of it, then we're not living at all.

## perfect
My country is by no means perfect, but at least we are free to criticize out government, vote in fair elections, and love whom we choose.

Sometimes, we screw things up for the better.

Sometimes things get messed up for the better.

I can’t see my way to a clear, definite ending for this plan. How do I act on a plan when I fell this doubt.

## pain / darkness
Haven't all students of history? Those who suffer heal. Everything destoryed get rebuilt. And our towers grow a little taller every time.

Pain and darkness, it's a part of me. I need it to fuel（推动） me, to push me to be a better person.

This darkness will pass.

Some wounds are so deep, they never truly heal.

I have given in to my demons.

My upbringing（成长经历） was only dysfunction. But dysfunction doesn't get to choose who you are.

I always try and mask my pain in front of beautiful women, 'cause I thing it makes me seem more masculine.

No one is responsible for the family they are born into. All that matters is who they decide to be, and you've decided to be brave and big-hearted.

## fear
The fear that's spreading 扩散 in this country like wildfire 星火燎原 isn't because the president lied. It's because she comes from some place different.

A leader who caves 屈服 to fear is no leader at all.

No matter how much we believe in ourselves, that never goes away. Not fully. Even now, I think I'm not afraid of anything. And then, something new and ugly rears its head and chasesme right back down the rabbit hole. But once we catch ourselves we have to jump right back out there.

I'm not afraid of enything. I just finally feel like the world is good. And I so badly want it to stay that way, even if it's just for a little while.

I was afraid to make wave 起冲突

Fear can create monsters where none existed before.

It was awful, and I just keep playing it over and over again in my head.

Fear makes us do a lot of things that we shouldn't.

Courage is the mastery of fear, not the absence of it.

I forgot what fear felt like.

### complicate
All I can say is that part of my life is very complicated.

The world is a much more complicated place than I realize.

### timing
I was waiting for some perfect moment which doesn't exist.

I want this, just, when the time is tight. 
But timing doesn't just happen.

I want to strike while the iron is hot.

### patience / slow
Greatness takes time. If a string（绳子） is in a knot, patience will untie it.

In my experience, the answers usually tend to come in time.

Sometimes you just have to slow down to get back to where you want to be.

A seedling's（幼苗） wait is over!

I'm just wondering if going after it now is premature（为时过早）
+ go after：追逐；追赶；寻找。
+ chase：爱情意义上的追求

## religion
We are all children in the eyes of God!

It's like I've gota deeper connection to religion than I've ever had.

In the Bible, it says that God created the world and saw that it was good. That is what you see when you look from stillness without thought.

### silence / 
True intelligence operates silently. Stillness is where creativity and solutions to problems are found.

I just needed to clear my head.

That's not a decision that can be made lightly.

It's hard to concentrate in these intense（紧张） situations.

#### 改变与适应
Things have changed.

Fitting in is hard enough, so many people telling you what to do and what to wear.

I was just starting to warm up to this place.

It's just a lot to take in right now.

Obviously, this is going to be a time of adjustment.

## thank / appreciate
Thank you god for this food are about to receive and for the nourishment of out bodies, and bless the hands that prepare it.

I guess this could all be mine someday.

## look forawad
what's done is done. All we can do now is look forward.

Instead of assigning blame, let's try to figure out what we're gonna do next.

## 冥想
There's nothing like a 20-second meditation micre-sesh to Zen out.

## trust
You just spent too much time with my sisters to be trusted.

## magic
Everything powerful is dangerous.

Absolute power corrupts. Having the ability to rewrite your own reality, it's too much temptation for anyone.

Being yourself, that is a magic stronger than any wish.
Being truly okay with myself. Scars and all is how the right people truly found me.

I learn magic the hard way.

A magician never reveals his secrets.

## 坦诚
I think that it's great that everything's just out there, right out in the open.

## 名言
Every time a door closes, a window opens.

Discovery requires experimentation

All powerful people have setbacks.

Usually, one person doesn't have the solution. But 100 people with 1% solution - That'll get it done.
Pieces solving a puzzle. 众人拾柴火焰高

The fuse was lit. 导火索已经引燃

## life
Life is a game of chance.（碰运气）

My hands are tied.（我无能为力）

Everything comes at a price.（世界没有免费的午餐）

The world is full of wonder.

Positive psychology can help you figure out where your true path is supposed to be.

## 纪录片
This astonishing new way of seeing the night offers a whole new understanding of lion family life.

Exploring is clearly exhausting work. But I give it everything I'm got to keep my family safe in the risk.

To stay clam in intense situations, my only option is to abandon my desire.

She's right to persevere（坚持不懈）.
 
Hyenas（鬣狗） are close by. And they're not the only threat.

The lioness（母狮子，单数） can sense the dangers.

Moving closer, she picks up a scent（气味）.

Guides and spotters（探查员） worked around the clock.（不眠不休）

Using these cameras, for me has been a real revelation. It's allowing us to see stuff that we would never normally see.

In the first hours of darkness, not everything is hiding in the shadows.

Next to the waterfall, it's hard to make yourself heard.

Another day draws to a close across S.W.

Evening is falling in the world's greatest tropical wetland.

The coming days and nights test him more than ever before.

He'll need to summon the strength to defend his river.

They'll feed on the corpses（巢穴） in the darkness of their burrows（尸体） in one of nature's most sinister（险恶）, but magical midnight feasts.

An agent of liberty. 自由的代表

I'd like to work in the shadow.

My rank is too low to avoid interrupting, but high enough to mastering time.

The impact 影响 has been far-reaching and profound 意义深远的

Never charge 冲锋 without a plan.

There's a fresh wave of anti-alien sentiment 情感

Let him who desires peace prepare for war.

What we choose to wear tells a story about who we are. Whether you wear black and leather or pastels and silk, you're creating an inner version of yourself whether you realize it or not.

I've been fighting on the front line for a lont time now.

Those days are behind me. I made a vow 誓言 to live a peaceful life
