## love
If I could save time in a bottle, I like to save every weekend, just to spend them with you.

when I told you that I missed you, I didn't mean to make you feel pressured.

Maybe we were meant to be together.

I'm not complete without you.

A home is more than bricks and mortar, it's a feeling of belonging, love, hope for the future.

What if I can't be the person that you need?

Whoever breaks her's in for a wide ride.

### animal / control
Don't deny the animal, but don't let it control you either.

## hard
I've tried harder at this than I ever have at anything.

## hope
The future isn't set. There is still hope.

## possibility
Sometimes, great possiblities are right in front of us, and we don't see them, because we choose not to.
He took a leap, and it changed his life for the better.

## choice
We have to live with the choices we make.

## perfect
My country is by no means perfect, but at least we are free to criticize out government, vote in fair elections, and love whom we choose.

Sometimes, we screw things up for the better.

I can’t see my way to a clear, definite ending for this plan. How do I act on a plan when I fell this doubt.

## pain / darkness
Haven't all students of history? Those who suffer head. Everything destoryed get rebuilt. And our towers grow a little taller every time.

Pain and darkness, it's a part of me. I need it to fuel（推动） me, to push me to be a better person.

This darkness will pass.

Some wounds are so deep, they never truly heal.

My upbringing（成长经历） was only dysfunction. But dysfunction doesn't get to choose who you are.

I always try and mask my pain in front of beautiful women, 'cause I thing it makes me seem more masculine.

## fear
Fear makes us do a lot of things that we shouldn't.

Courage is the mastery of fear, not the absence of it.

## life
Life is a game of chance（碰运气）

My hands are tied.（我无能为力）

### complicate
All I can say is that part of my life is very complicated.

The world is a much more complicated place than I realize.

### silence / 
I just needed to clear my head.

That's not a decision that can be made lightly.

It's hard to concentrate in these intense（紧张） situations.

#### 改变与适应
Things have changed.

I was just starting to warm up to this place.

It's just a lot to take in right now.

Obviously, this is going to be a time of adjustment.

### patience / slow
Greatness takes time. If a string（绳子） is in a knot, patience will untie it.

In my experience, the answers usually tend to come in time.

Sometimes you just have to slow down to get back to where you want to be.

I'm just wondering if going after it now is premature（为时过早）
+ go after：追逐；追赶；寻找。
+ chase：爱情意义上的追求

## thank / appreciate
Thank you god for this food are about to receive and for the nourishment of out bodies, and bless the hands that prepare it.

I guess this could all be mine someday.

## look forawad
what's done is done. All we can do now is look forward.

Instead of assigning blame, let's try to figure out what we're gonna do next.

## magic
Everything powerful is dangerous.

Absolute power corrupts. Having the ability to rewrite your own reality, it's too much temptation for anyone.

I have given in to my demons.

Being yourself, that is a magic stronger than any wish.
Being truly okay with myself. Scars and all is how the right people truly found me.

A magician never reveals his secrets.

## 坦诚
I think that it's great that everything's just out there, right out in the open.

## 名言
Every time a door closes, a window opens.

Pieces solving a puzzle. 众人拾柴火焰高

Discovery requires experimentation

All powerful people have setbacks.

The world is full of wonder.
